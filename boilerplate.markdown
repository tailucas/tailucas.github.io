This page is a quick link to my most generically reusable projects:

1) my project boilerplate package [base-app][base-app-url] whose multi-architecture images are maintained by me in the [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/tailucas/base-app/pkgs/container/base-app) and [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/tailucas/base-app/tags).

2) my common Python library package [pylib][pylib-url].

3) my companion "reference implementation" [simple-app][simple-app-url] which serves as the template for any new application I want to create based on the boilerplate I've created.

You can read more about the composition and problems solved by these projects in my post [here](https://tailucas.github.io/update/2025/12/07/maintaining-the-boilerplate.html).
